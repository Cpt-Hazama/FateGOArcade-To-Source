# Python Requirements
- Pillow
- NumPy

# Recommended
Using my modified Noesis plugin will allow better compatibility with this script: https://github.com/Cpt-Hazama/FGO-Arcade-OBJ-Noesis-Plugin

# Usage
- Copy the script into a directory containing TGA files extracted from Fate/Grand Order Arcade (or put the textures in the script's directory)
- Run the script via command prompt: python fgoa.py
- It will create a folder in the directory called 'Converted', which will contain the newly setup textures (note the output prints for any failures in the script)

# Notes
- You can find my example VMT stuff in the 'VMT Examples' folder, as well as the required shaders, to recreate the visuals from Fate/Grand Order Arcade
