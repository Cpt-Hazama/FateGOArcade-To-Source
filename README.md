# Python Requirements
- Pillow
- NumPy

# Usage
- Copy the script into a directory containing TGA files extracted from Fate/Grand Order Arcade
- Run the script via command prompt: python fgoa.py
- It will create a folder in the directory called 'Converted', which will contain the newly setup textures (note the output prints for any failures in the script)

# Notes
- _a texture stuff sometimes fails, need to figure that out
- _bs textures are still a bit of a mystery, I honestly can't tell if it's a type of ambient occlusion or actually just a specular map
- You can find my example VMT stuff at the top of the script, as well as the required shaders, to recreate the visuals from Fate/Grand Order Arcade
